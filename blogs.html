    <legend><b>Features of Java Explained</b></legend>
    <p>The popular programming language Java has been around for more than 20 years. Its popularity can be attributed to, among other things, its portability, security, and scalability. Being a cross-platform language, its ability to function on several systems is one of the main factors in its appeal. Java is an object-oriented language that also includes a robust type system and allows automatic memory management. It is a powerful language for creating complex programmes thanks to its built-in support for multithreading and security features. In addition, Java features a simple syntax and a comprehensive API, making it simple to learn and use. 

        Java is being used by more than 9 million developers around the world. It continues to be a widely used language in the software development industry thanks to its popularity and adaptability, which have made it a favourite among entrepreneurs and developers alike.
        
        Java includes a huge selection of libraries and frameworks that make it simpler for programmers to create sophisticated applications. There are many useful classes and functions in Java’s standard library, and additional libraries and frameworks streamline the development process while adding even more capability.</p>
        <b>Advantages of using Java</b>

        <p> The use of Java as a programming language has a number of benefits. Some of the main benefits are as follows:
            
            Java is a straightforward programming language since it is simple to learn and comprehend.
            Java uses implicit pointers, making it a secure programming language.
            Java code does not need to be constantly compiled in order to execute on a variety of systems.
            Java has strong memory management, making it a robust programming language.
            The above are some of the advantages of using Java and building applications making it the most popular programming language after Python.

    <p>Why and How to learn Python Programming Language?
 
 
        Python is the programming language behind giant applications like YouTube, Instagram, Spotify, Uber, Netflix, and many more apps.
        
        But are you still wondering whether or not you should learn it? Should you add it to your knowledge stack?
        
        Direct answer- Yes! Learning it will assure you a great job, a high package, brilliant opportunities, amazing communities, and a successful and fulfilling software development career.
        
        Python is a general-purpose, interpreted high-level software development language developed in 1991, yet recently gained popularity with the 3rd version of Python ( Python 3).
        
        Let’s look at the reasons for the language’s popularity and how you can learn Python in the most engaging and practical way.
        
        Why was Python developed?
        Guido van Rossum, a software developer, got frustrated with the complex and tedious languages he was working with. Hence in the 1980s, he picked the project of developing a syntactically beautiful, simple, easy, and fun-to-use language. Fun! The name suggests that already. But to understand what made Python one of the most loved programming languages continue reading below.
        
        Features of Python Language
        Here are the 5 major reasons that make the Python language so popular with a fan base calling themselves “Pythonistas”.
        
        1. Python is beginner-friendly.
        Python features very closely with the English syntax and is super easy to read even by someone, not a coder. It uses fewer lines of code and simple rules with no semicolon at the end of every line or confusing brackets. 
        
        For example, here’s a simple code to print “Hello, world” implemented in C (right) and Python (left). Python needs just one line.

        2. Python is Easy to Learn
        Python’s rules and syntax are very easy compared to other popular languages like C, C++, and Java. Another thing that makes Python simple is that it is an interpreted language. Interpreted language means when you write a program in C or C++, you write the complete code and then check for errors in the compiler. But with Python, you can check if your code is error-free in every line and correct if it’s wrong.</p>

    <legend><b>What is Full-stack Web Development</b></legend>
    <p>A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming is known as a full-stack developer. They have experience dealing with a variety of web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, servers, APIs, and frameworks, among others.

        Let’s take the building of a Facebook-like social media platform as an example. The front-end and back-end of the application would be built by a full-stack developer focusing on this project.
        
        In order to generate the platform’s visual elements, the developer would design the user interface on the front end using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, they would leverage front-end frameworks like React or Angular to speed up the development process.
        
        In order to manage the data and process requests, the developer would write the server-side code using tools like Node.js and PHP. To store user data and other data, they would also employ databases like MySQL or MongoDB.
        
        The integration of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for functions like authentication, messaging, and notifications would also fall within the purview of a complete stack developer.
        
        The full-stack developer may make sure that all parts are flawlessly linked and work together as an integrated unit by working on both the front-end and back-end of the social media platform. Because of the wide breadth of technical knowledge and problem-solving skills required, full-stack developers are in high demand in the software development sector.</p>
